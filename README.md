# j-pop-sound-mixing
This was a mini-project that had me look for a site that could transpose the music I wanted to transpose (in this case, two songs), and cur the songs so that the whole song would be in one key (D major/b minor)

## Description
I like (some) J-Pop and I also like songs that are in a certain key (D major/b minor), so I decided to make transposed versions of some songs I liked.
The songs I used were "Lag Train" and "Children Record" (the former is a Vocaloid song, while the latter is sung my real people), where I used an online software (https://vocalremover.org/) to transpose and cut/trim the files and to transpose the individual parts themselves (you might hear a "disjoint" in the music in "Children Record".
I also had to use some of my music theory knowledge to detect where there was modulation (changes in key) of the song, so that I can seperate those parts and transpose them seperately (I wanted to have the whole song in one key)

The song I had worked the most on (children record with all b minot/f# minor transposition): https://github.com/AnomaliScript/j-pop-sound-mixing/blob/main/CR%202-3%23%20washed.mp3

## Usage
The audio files are free to download, and they are in keys of F# and B minor.
